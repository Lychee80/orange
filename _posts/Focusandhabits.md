# Laurie Santos notes
- A lot of students experience depression and anxiety due to all the stress from grades and classes
- In the end things don't matter as much as they seem like in the moment so don't take things too much to heart
- Good things and bad things will happen and that's normal
- It's really hard to find happiness but you have to keep on going and put in the effort into it
-  Your intuition about what is good for you is often wrong like we think making money will make us happier even though it doesn't always will --> we end up wanting more and more and so are never satisfied 
- its good to spend more time with others (especially with family or happy people)
- social interaction, showing gratitude and happiness for what you have in life, and helping others makes you happier
- make good habits such as sleeping more 
- its important to value your time since those who do are often happier 
- To do all of these things, you have to change your priorities to do things that will make you happier and healthier instead 

# Thanks for the people in my life 

Someone I'm very grateful for is my parents since they're always there when I need them

Dear Mom, 
Thank you for always being there for me when I'm in upset. You always manage to comfort me and make me feel better despite what I'm going through. Thank you for always cooking delicious food and taking care of me.
